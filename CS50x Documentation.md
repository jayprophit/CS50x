### binary
computers speak in 0's and 1's

### unary
counting on your fingers, meaning each finger/ tendem is a unit

### base-1
if the fingers there or its not

### base-2 Binary Digit
just needs 2 digits,  this can be called or known as:-

- 1 & 2
- A & B
- Black & white
- etc

this is defined as 2 words to describe two pieces of information.  in onputers its known as Binary, 0 and 1, off and on

### bit
a single digit is a 0 or 1

### transistors
are like a switch or like a light bulb storing electricity, switched/ turned on or off

- if there is no current/ electricity then its OFF and is also represented by the digit 0
- if there is a flow of current/ electricity then it is ON and this is also represented by a 1 meaining there is a flow or current available or ready to use, or its active
